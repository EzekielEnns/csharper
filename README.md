this projects aim is to decouple
the lsp from rosyln analysis so that you can have a decent experience using 
csharp without needing to run rosyln analysis so the heavy stuff happens only when
you need it


we will be implementing omnisharp [lsp client and server](https://github.com/OmniSharp/csharp-language-server-protocol/blob/master/docs/lsp.md)


# my target
I wanna make it so that i can spawn one of thse lang server for neovim
